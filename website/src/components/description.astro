                Leaf is a powerful flight computer in a tiny package â€“ small enough to strap to a riser, but crammed full of capability.
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>
                All valuable flight information is shown on screen, and behind the scenes Leaf will log your data and flight tracks to the SD card in KML and IGC format.
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>
                While Leaf is a complete flight computer package, you can also pair to other devices with Bluetooth and WiFi to expand even further.
            </p>

                Leaf is designed to mount anywhere: attach to a riser or harness strap, mount to a flight deck, or use the included snap-in base plate for even more mounting options (velcro strap and safety lanyard included).
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>
                Best of all, Leaf is Open Source, and will be constantly improving with community input and feedback.  Feel free to share your ideas!
