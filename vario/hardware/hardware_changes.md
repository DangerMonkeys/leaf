## PCBA

### v3.2.7
This version is identical to v3.2.6, except the IO_expander address pins were incorrectly wired in v3.2.6.  This version fixes that.
+ IO Expander Address: IOEX_ADDR = 0x20 (same as v3.2.5)

### v3.2.6
+ Added 10pin connector for Sharp Memory-in-Pixel display
+ IMU rotated 90deg clockwise (+X is "forward" now)
+ Removed 0-ohm configuration resistors not being used
+ Reposition LoRa module and I2C connector to make hand-soldering LoRa easier 
+ Remove ground plane contact from LoRa ground pins to reduce heat-sink effect when soldering
+ Scoot LoRa and I2C connectors further 'rearward' (versus 3.2.5); this brings the battery closer to the original 3.2.4 position; though battery is still a bit forward from 3.2.4.
+ Temp/Humidity "isolation slot" is shrunk toward rear slightly -- needs plastic case modification
+ Increased size of R21 (backlight LED resistor) to allow easier hand-solder replacement if user needs a different R-value
+ Added ISET, LED, and PWR_GOOD to ESP32
++ ISET: Using ESP32 ADC, can read actual charging current from charger IC
++ LED: ESP32 can now control green power LED (previously was on only when USB plugged in)
++ PWR_GOOD allows ESP32 to measure presence of input power
++ All of the above will allow more fine control over power supply modes and reactions

+ Significant Pin Changes to accommodate the above and also make full use of IO-expander

| B7 P17 |GPS_BAK_EN  | N/C         |

+ Note: IO Expander Address pins wired incorrectly, so IOEX_ADDR = 0x26 for this version (not 0x20 as in v3.2.5).

### v3.2.5

#### Changes
+ Replace bare ESP32S3 with full module (ESP32-S3-MINI-1).  Can utilize Espressif's FCC and CE certifications
+ Add optional LoRa module (Wio-SX1262 by SeeedStudio).  NOTE: with LoRa module installed, battery moves forward in position by 3mm compared to 3.2.4.  May not fit in case design v3.2.4.
+ Add IO Expander for 16 more GPIO pins
+ Adjust USB-EN voltage divider (used for signaling HI on power_enable and also GPS backup power when no battery).  Also connected USB-EN to GPS Backup Regulator, instead of GPS directly.  These changes allow for higher input voltage on USB connector (now limit is 9V vs previous 6V).  
+ Moved all header pins to one edge (out of the way of ESP module antenna)
+ Moved Charge, VCC 3.3 circuitry and battery connector to make more room for battery
+ Other minor changes
